# Graph-Maker
Making Graphs Using Matplotlib

In this repository, I have made a software application that can be used to generate graph like Bar charts, Histograms and Pie charts.
Let's see 
- **Bar Chart**

As you can see in above image a bar chart is generated using software application named as **Graph Maker**. In this,After clicking on Insert Manually button we can give inputs directly through input text fields. After clicking on Generate Graph button graph will be generated & displayed, we can save this graph as an image.
We can also input as csv file(a demo csv file is already given in this repository named demo.csv) using that csv file graph will be generate(output images provided in output images folder in this repo)

- **Histogram**
